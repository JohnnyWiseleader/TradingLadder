# TradingLadder
Many brokerage trading platforms have a trading ladder sometimes known as a DOM (depth of market).  E*Trade had one in the past but it is no longer. 

Using a wrapper for E*Trade's REST API PyEtrade and PyQt5 I am attempting to rectify this.

This is a work in progress and I have just recently begun it.
